# Vigenere Cipher
---
This python program is a general implementation of the Vigenere Cipher. For whatever word is assigned to the variable key, it will encrypt a message using that key, it can also decrypt the message given any key.

Say for example that you wanted to encrypt the message "The enemy will attack at sunset." Using the key "enigma". The letter "T" in the message would be shifted by 5 letters, "h" by 14, "e" by 9, and so on. The key would be repeated until it is the same length as the message. The encrypted message would be "otv xadhk nbyk vfktpj vf jnarzf."
